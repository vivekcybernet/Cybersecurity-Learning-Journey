# Offensive Cybersecurity Roadmap & Learning Repository

👋 Hi, I'm **Vivek Maurya**

Welcome to my **Offensive Cybersecurity Learning Repository**. This GitHub repo documents my **complete journey into Offensive Cybersecurity / Ethical Hacking**, following a **structured, professional, and industry-aligned roadmap**.

This repository is not just notes — it is a **hands-on knowledge base**, **practice hub**, and **reference guide** designed for **deep understanding and real-world application**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is created to:

* 📚 Document my **step-by-step learning journey** in Offensive Cybersecurity
* 🧠 Build **strong theoretical foundations** before using tools
* 🛠️ Practice **real-world techniques** used by security professionals
* 🧪 Maintain **labs, exercises, and examples** for every module
* 📝 Create **clean, structured notes** that can help others learn
* 🚀 Prepare for **CTFs, bug bounty, pentesting, and security roles**

Everything here is focused on **learning the right way**, not shortcut hacking.

---

## 🧭 Learning Philosophy

I strictly follow these principles:

* **Concept → Protocol → Tool → Practice**
* No blind tool usage without understanding internals
* Focus on **why** something works, not just **how**
* Emphasis on **mistakes to avoid**, **defensive perspective**, and **ethics**
* Continuous mapping to **real-world attack scenarios**
