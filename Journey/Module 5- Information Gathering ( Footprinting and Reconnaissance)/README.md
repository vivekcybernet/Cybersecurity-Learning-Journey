# Module 05 – Information Gathering  
## Footprinting & Reconnaissance

Information Gathering, also known as **Footprinting and Reconnaissance**, is the **first and most critical phase** of the hacking and penetration testing lifecycle.  
This module focuses on **collecting detailed intelligence about a target organization, system, or network** before any active exploitation is attempted.

Accurate information gathering helps in understanding the **attack surface, security posture, technologies, and potential vulnerabilities** of the target.

---

## 📌 Module Overview

This module covers both **Passive** and **Active** reconnaissance techniques used by attackers and penetration testers to gather information **ethically and systematically**.

Topics include:
- OSINT techniques
- Search engine footprinting
- Website, DNS, Network, and Email footprinting
- Tool-based reconnaissance
- Real-world attack surface discovery methods
